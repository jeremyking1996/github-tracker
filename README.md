Using github example API to track data of any user you wish. Implemented a catch to allow for searching an invalid user then going back to search for an actual user. Will provide pictures when formatting is fixed!

# Tech Stack
Used React.js and fetched an API, further used semantic-react-ui to download a few components, such as Card, Image, and Form.
